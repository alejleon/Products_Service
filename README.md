# Thread Lightly Products Service
## Overview

The Thread Lightly product service is a reconstructed API for a mock e-commerce clothing retailer. The goal was to optimize the back end for speed and responsiveness under heavier loads. The project consisted of working with an inherited front-end and making it work with the same endpoints and formats the client-side code was expecting. The work was carried out within a team of three, each of whom was responsible for a different API service. I was responsible for the products service.

This project is a sister project to [Thread Lightly retail portal](https://github.com/alejleon/project_catwalk).


## Achievements
 - Composed ELT pipeline using MongoDB Compass, the Mongo aggregation pipeline, and the Mongo CLI to seed database with over 22 million records. 
 - Improved query retrieval speeds by 97% over the legacy code by taking advantage of indexing and embedded documents, decreasing response time to as little as 4ms.
 - Maintained a 0% error rate at 1000 requests per second during stress testing.
