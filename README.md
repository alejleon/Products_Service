# Thread Lightly Products Service
## Overview

The Thread Lightly product service is a reconstructed API for a mock e-commerce clothing retailer. The goal was to optimize the back end for speed and responsiveness under heavier loads. The project consisted of working with an inherited front-end and making it work with the same endpoints and formats the client-side code was expecting. The work was carried out within a team of three, each of whom was responsible for a different API service. I was responsible for the products service.

This project is a sister project to [Thread Lightly retail portal](https://github.com/alejleon/project_catwalk).
